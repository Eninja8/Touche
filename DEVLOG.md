# Touché dev log

## Current state
- **Playable:** local 2-player (one keyboard), vs CPU (easy/normal/hard), menu demo bout, settings with key rebinding, sound, ragdoll deaths. Fixed 120 Hz simulation.
- **Live:** https://eninja8.github.io/Touche/ (GitHub Pages, updates on every push to `main`).
- **Code:** split into `src/sim` (deterministic simulation), `src/view` (drawing, effects, sound) and `src/ui` (input, menus). See README.md for the layout.
- **Determinism:** `npm test` passes: same seed gives the same match, and rewind-and-replay matches exactly.
- **Next:** Phase 2, online 1v1 with room codes. Plan: `docs/ONLINE-PLAN.md`. **Waiting for the owner's OK** (and OK to add PeerJS).

## Session log

### 2026-10-14: Phase 1 (setup, restructure, deploy)
- Checked tools: Node.js v20.11.1 (past end-of-life; upgraded in the next session), npm 10.2.4, git 2.44.
- Created the git repo with `.gitignore`/`.gitattributes`, committed the original single-file game as-is, pushed to github.com/Eninja8/Touche. Switched this repo to Git Credential Manager for sign-in.
- Split `index.html` into modules without changing gameplay:
  - Simulation is a plain state object `S` plus `step(S, commands)`. No DOM, clocks or `Math.random` inside `src/sim`.
  - **Determinism fixes:**
    - CPU decisions and round-start timers used `Math.random`; they now use a seeded generator (`src/sim/rng.js`) whose state lives in `S.rng`.
    - The mouse position was read straight from a global inside the fighter update; it now arrives as part of the per-tick command (`aim`).
    - Key presses were written into fighter buffers directly from keyboard events (between ticks); they're now queued and applied at the start of the next tick.
    - Countdown and KO timers ran on real (wall-clock) time; they now count ticks. KO pause = 180 ticks, which with slow motion still takes about 1.9 real seconds, as before.
    - The clash freeze-frame (hitstop) paused the loop by real time; it's now 6 frozen ticks inside the sim.
    - Blood/sparks choice, particles, ragdolls and screen shake were inside the sim; they're now cosmetic, driven by events (`src/sim/events.js`).
  - KO slow motion stays as a "feed ticks slower" effect in `main.js`; flagged for online play in the Phase 2 plan.
  - Added `body{margin:0}` and a proper HTML document head (the old file had no `<!doctype>`).
- Added `npm start` (zero-dependency local server, `tools/serve.mjs`) and `npm test` (`tools/determinism-test.mjs`).
- Verified in headless Chrome: no console errors; ~5.5 minutes of fast-forwarded CPU-vs-CPU bouts (86 touches) without errors; a full CPU match reaches the game-over screen (0–5).
- Enabled GitHub Pages (main branch, root). Live site checked.
- Wrote CLAUDE.md and the Phase 2 online plan.

### 2026-10-14: Phase 2 kickoff
Owner approved the online plan and PeerJS with its free public server.

**Part 1, Node upgrade:** installed Node.js v24.20.0 LTS with winget (was v20.11.1, end-of-life). `npm test` passes on Node 24. `package.json` now states `"engines": {"node": ">=24"}`.
